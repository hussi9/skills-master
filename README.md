# skill-router

> One file. Routes every Claude Code task to the right Skill, Agent, and Model — before any tool fires.

![chain announcement](assets/proof/chain-multi-domain.png)

```
You type:    lets start teh implementation
Router says: This touches 3 domains: UI/Frontend, DB, Edge function.
             Chain: writing-plans → dispatching-parallel-agents → frontend-design + db-expert
```

## Why

Claude Code can use hundreds of skills. It picks the wrong one ~20% of the time, skips skills it decides are "too simple," and burns `opus` tokens on tasks that need `haiku`. `skill-router` replaces that implicit choice with a deterministic 3-question triage that runs before every non-trivial task.

## Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-router
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hussi9/skill-router/main/SKILL.md \
  > ~/.claude/skills/skill-router/SKILL.md
```

That's it. Claude Code auto-loads it on session start. You never invoke it manually.

**Verify it's working:** start a Claude Code session, type `lets add a settings page that writes to the database`. Before any tool fires, you should see something like:

```
This touches 2 domains: UI/Frontend, DB schema.
Chain: writing-plans → frontend-design + db-expert
```

If you see that announcement, the router is loaded. If Claude jumps straight into reading files, the skill didn't load — check the path under `~/.claude/skills/skill-router/SKILL.md` exists and `name: skill-router` is in the frontmatter.

## Measured

20 real prompts through `claude -p` (test harness in [`run_routing_test.sh`](./run_routing_test.sh)):

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Path + Skill + Model correct | 18/20 (**90%**) |
| Skill tool actually fires correctly | 7/8 (**88%**) |
